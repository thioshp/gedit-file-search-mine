This is a test file for "whole-word" search option.

Some text with an a and an aa and aaa and abc and ab...

There is no Letter_a standalone in this line.



German word for houses:
Häuser
The word "Häuser" can also be written as "Haeuser" to avoid using Umlauts like the letters ä and Ä are.

Hint: search for "also " (note the trailing space...)


Here: the word also  with _two_ trailing spaces

There are some ambiguous situations when searching for "whole words"; esp.
between grep (as tested on Jaunty) and simple '\b...\b' RE searching.

Also, grep (at least on Jaunty and Lucid) has errors regarding its -w option;
see eg. http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-grep@gnu.org/msg01621.html

Decisions to make:
- given "@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b":
  - should it find "+" as whole word? -> YES
  - should it find "A-Z0" as whole word? -> YES
  - should it find "[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]" as whole word? -> YES
- given "abc xyz foo bar":
  - should it find "xyz " as whole word? -> YES
  - should it find "xyz foo" as whole word? -> YES
  - should it find " " as whole word? -> YES
- given "abc xyz  foo bar":
  - should it find "xyz " as whole word? -> ???
- given "xyz  foo":
  - should it find " " as whole word? -> ???
  - should it find "  " as whole word? -> ???
- given "this doesn't work":
  - should it find "t" as whole word? -> YES
  - should it find "doesn't" as whole word? -> YES
- given "instance_signal_id_pair":
  - should it find "pair" as whole word? -> NO
  - should it find "_" as whole word? -> NO
