File Search Plugin for Gedit
=============================
This is a search plugin for Gedit 2 to search for a text inside a directory.

The plugin should work with Gedit 2.16 and higher (that would be for example Ubuntu Edgy 6.10, or Debian Etch, or RedHat Enterprise Linux 5, or anything newer than that).
Note that this plugin does not support Gedit 3 - **there is another plugin version available which does support Gedit 3**.

Note for users of RHEL and Scientific Linux: make sure the "gnome-python2-gconf" package is installed; otherwise the plugin cannot be enabled.

Installation
-------------

* [download the plugin] [1]
* unpack the tgz file
* copy the contents of the gedit-file-search folder to ~/.gnome2/gedit/plugins/ (create that folder if necessary)
* start Gedit, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins, and enable "File Search"
